# Renderer_Vulkan

A real-time renderer using C++ and the Vulkan API. Topics explored will include efficient data handling strategies; culling and scene traversal; multi-threaded rendering; post-processing, depth of field, screen-space reflections; volumetric rendering; sample distribution, spatial and temporal sharing, and anti-aliasing; stereo view synthesis; physical simulation and collision detection; dynamic lights and shadows; global illumination, accelerated raytracing; dynamic resolution, "AI" upsampling; compute shaders; parallax occlusion mapping; tessellation, displacement; skinning, transform feedback; and debugging, profiling, and accelerating graphics algorithms.

#Prerequisite
- GLFW 3.4
- the Vulkan SDK

#Usage:
in a vcvars64.bat'd command prompt
```
